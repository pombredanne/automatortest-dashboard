	<h4> Other comments</h4>
	<p>
		We proudly participate in the development of the
		data mining tools used in this analysis, which are all of them free / open source software. Those can be found at
		the <a href="https://github.com/MetricsGrimoire">Metrics Grimoire project</a>.
	<p>
	<p>
		The visualization part is also based on partially modified free software code, most of it being <a href="http://humblesoftware.com/envision/">Envision</a> by HumbleSoftware. The rest of the toolchain is mainly <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R</a>, an incredible statistical tool
		that helps us to analyze the dataset and produce the cooked data which is shown.
